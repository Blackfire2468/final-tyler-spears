There are many things I like to do in my everyday life but there is one thing I enjoy above all and that is playing video games. With the use of platforms like steam on the computer there are almost infinite games to play and that being said there is one game that i liked to play above the rest and that was rocket league. Back when i started playing rocket league it was a simple game that can be defined in just a few words “Car Soccer". The whole concept seemed odd at first. Why would I want to drive around a field chasing a ball to play soccer? That's where it gets entertaining.

Rocket league used to be called supersonic acrobatic rocket powered battle cars or SARPBC for short this game didn't have many things to do and was overall a simple idea to drive into the ball and put it in the net but that's not what it became. Over the years rocket league has developed far beyond what even the developers thought it would become. With a simple name change and some upgraded graphics that when it became the staple it is today. The game was fun to me with this simple concept but that's what was so good about it. Anyone could pick up the game and already know what needs to be done. There are no hard rules to learn and no set guideline of how to play. All you need to do is drive into the ball. This is when the game turned and people got better. 

That's when mechanics came into play. These are cool shots you can do while playing these games. This includes musty flicks which involve flicking the ball off of the car to get power. Flip resets which involves getting a reset or your flip back while having possession of the ball. There are so many more to name: pogos, ground pinch, kuxir pinch, brezzi flick and so much more but that's just to name a few. Most of these mechanics are named for what they do like a ground pinch is literally pitching the ball between the floor and your car to get a lot of power and other mechanics are named based off of the person that found them. These come into play every game as each person tries to do them and doing one correctly can decide the fate of the game. The double jump originally rocket league cars could only do one jump but then the developers added a second jump this made most of the mechanics possible as it allowed the car to move in ways it never could prior. That's when a major bug was found in order to reset your double jump and to get it back you had to land all four wheels back on the ground. This made it so you can get your jump back but also couldn't use it infinitely. People discovered that if you land on the ball in a certain way you can actually reset this flip and get another one off this created so of the most powerful and new mechanics like the flip reset. 

The game tries to be balanced by ranking each player by their skill level from bronze all the way to supersonic legend where everyone aims to be. Only the top .1% of players actually make it there. This separates players by skill level so that you go against people that are similar in rank to you this creates a semi balanced game as both sides should be similar but it creates a lot of different games as each players play style and skill differs quite a bit. Currently I'm a diamond 3 / champ 1 player but it has also been a minute since I last played so that rank can differ a little. 

Finally the takeover this is when epic games the creator of fortnite took over rocket league in doing so when they bought it they made it free to play meaning anyone can download and play the game this made the influx of the player base skyrock and allowed for a lot of new diverse skills to enter the game but this also created a big problem… in making the game free they invited people to be smurfs this is when a player that was high skill level would make a second account and play the game but either play internally bad or play with one of their lower ranked friends this would be because either they couldn't play rank with that friend because the ranks are too far apart or they just wanted to play lower level matches but you can see how this starts to become unfair now that making a new account was free and didn't cost the user 20$ dollars and rebuy the game the players could make themselves seem worse and they end up just dominating the other team since the skill level is so off. The next thing that epic did was get rid of trading this made it so that players could no longer give each other items meaning that if you had something valuable and wanted to trade it for something you liked more you can no longer do that these things started to make the game less fun i could no longer trade cool items i got for something i wanted more and every game that you went into the opponents skill level was higher then they should be this made the game it is today and that's fine with me. But it's no longer my first picked game and after having over 1000 hours in the game it disappoints me a little.
