[{"content":"\rConcert Review 1\nFor my concert review I went to see The Life and Music of George Michael. It was performed by a small band of 6 people as a tribute to George Michael’s life. For their setup they had a lead vocalist who sang majority of the songs and a side vocalist who was used for the woman parts and songs and added depth to the music. There was one guitarist who switched between electric guitars on the left of the stage and one bass guitarist. The drummer was placed into the middle and lastly a person playing a keyboard on the right. It took place at the Lexington Opera House and lasted for two hours and thirty minutes. The people there made the mood of the atmosphere change as originally i thought it was going to be a little fancier but turned into a causal thing as the band started playing and people started to relax. I really enjoyed the concert more than I thought I would since the lead vocalist made it such an enjoyable experience and was very nice to the audience. As far as dislikes I can\u0026rsquo;t say there were too many since it was an overall good experience. The only problem was when the audience was being too loud where it would block some of the story of his life from hearing. The first George Michael song that I want to cover is when he was still with wham. While with wham he made some of the top charts as their songs had a memorable tune. The first song is Last Christmas. This song was written in 1984 by George Michael and produced by wham. It became one of the top selling christmas songs and still hits charts today. It has a slow and sad meaning behind it like most of the songs that George Michael wrote. But its pace is pretty normal, not being too slow but definitely being slower than other songs during its time. The song incorporates the use of drums and guitars as well as vocals and some keyboards as they can produce a wide variety of sound. I think this overall piece is a classic and is really well done as I hear it every Christmas time. George Michael is also really good at making his songs invoke a certain feeling on you to make you feel his pain but also in a way that covers it to not leave you confused or upset. The next song by George Michael is Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go. This song reached the charts and brought the new pop of the time out. This song helped the way of modern pop music and became a number one on the charts for some time. No longer as popular today as it was then unlike Last Christmas it is still a recognized and loved song. It involves the same type of instruments including the guitar, drums, and keyboard. This song also has a different meaning as Go-Go refers to a dance or a club and that the main person wants to be woken up before they get left. This also shows how George Michael’s songs were mainly written about upset or heartbreak even with a happier tune and upbeat music. I think this song is good and deserves its spot up in the top but at the same time I feel as though it will remain in the 80s as it has slowly become more outdated. The last song that I\u0026rsquo;m going to talk about is Careless Whispers. This song like the other ones i have talked about was also made by George Michael and was made during his time with wham. Unfortunately after George Michael left wham and became on his own his songs took a different approach and not as many hit the charts like these ones. Careless Whispers hit the charts at number 1 in the UK and USA where it remained there for 52 weeks. One of the longest songs has remained on the number 1 spot. This song also contained the same instruments as the others as it was their common band instrument at that time. This song has a slower pace and like all the other ones has a sad message under the great melody. I think that this song is good as it talks about how he is never going to get over this girl but due to how most of his songs are, they all feel similar in a different way, still conveying the same message but having different beats and rhymes. Overall I think that the Concert was really good as the band did a really good job and danced and moved with the music. The venue was also really nice and felt like I was there in an older time as it felt less modern. The music was good as well as the lights on the stage moved with the beat and you could really feel the beat of the music. I was moving with the music. I don’t know if I would say that the music moved me in an emotional sense. However the music and the overall performance exceeded my expectations as I didn’t think that it would be much fun but I did enjoy that experience.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blogs/blog7/","title":"A Review of George Michael Concert"},{"content":"\rPage 1:\nThe city stretched out before Theo like a cruel experiment in contrasts. On one side, towering skyscrapers glittered with opulence, reaching towards a perpetually flawless sky. On the other, the decaying slums sprawled like a festering wound, casting shadows over those condemned to live within.\nTheo\u0026rsquo;s young eyes absorbed this stark division with a mixture of awe and resentment. Born into the heart of poverty, he couldn\u0026rsquo;t escape the omnipresent disparity that separated the immortal elite from the struggling masses. The air was thick with the scent of despair, but Theo\u0026rsquo;s spirit remained unbroken.\nWithin the cramped quarters of their dilapidated apartment, Theo\u0026rsquo;s family weathered the storm of destitution. His mother, a pillar of resilience, juggled odd jobs to keep the family afloat. Theo\u0026rsquo;s sister, Lily, stood by his side, her support unwavering amidst the chaos. Their father, once robust, now frail and desperate, dreamed of a chance at longevity, an elusive commodity reserved for the privileged few.\nAs the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows over the slums, Theo felt a flicker of defiance ignite within him. A mysterious longing for change propelled him forward. Little did he know that his journey would unravel the hidden layers of a resistance determined to shatter the chains of immortality that bound society, forcing him into a dangerous dance that challenged the very foundations of their divided world.\nPage 2:\nTheo\u0026rsquo;s routine began with the dawn, a symphony of necessity dictating his actions. The air in the slums carried whispers of the privileged lives just beyond his reach, as if taunting him with the promise of a reality he couldn\u0026rsquo;t fathom.\nAmid the crumbling infrastructure and makeshift dwellings, Theo navigated the maze of narrow alleyways, avoiding the prying eyes of those who would exploit his vulnerability. His mother\u0026rsquo;s words echoed in his mind, a mantra of survival that propelled him forward. \u0026ldquo;Keep your head down, Theo. Eyes on the ground, and walk with purpose.\u0026rdquo;\nPurpose. The word resonated with Theo, becoming a beacon of hope in the sea of hopelessness. He dared to dream of a life beyond the confines of the slums, a life where his family could break free from the chains of poverty.\nOne evening, while navigating the labyrinthine streets, Theo stumbled upon a hidden enclave. A group of clandestine figures huddled in the shadows, their murmurs carrying the weight of rebellion. Drawn by a force he couldn\u0026rsquo;t comprehend, Theo approached cautiously, feeling the undercurrents of a movement that sought to challenge the very essence of immortality.\nAs he became entangled in their clandestine discussions, Theo glimpsed a different world—a world where the gap between the rich and the destitute could be bridged. The resistance, fueled by a shared vision of equality, welcomed him into their fold. Unbeknownst to Theo, he had embarked on a dangerous journey that would test his limits, unravel hidden truths, and force him to confront the oppressive system that had defined his existence.\nPage 3:\nThe resistance became Theo\u0026rsquo;s clandestine refuge, a haven for those who dared to defy the immortality divide. Within the dimly lit meeting room, faces shrouded in shadows revealed stories of stolen dreams, lost opportunities, and the ceaseless struggle against a system rigged in favor of the immortal elite.\nA charismatic figure emerged as their leader, his eyes ablaze with determination. Rebecca, a seasoned veteran of the resistance, spoke of a daring plan to expose the truth behind the facade of eternal life. As Theo listened intently, the weight of responsibility settled on his shoulders. The boy from the slums found himself at the heart of a movement poised to challenge the status quo.\nDays turned into nights as Theo trained with the resistance, honing skills he never knew he possessed. Each passing moment fueled his determination to dismantle the oppressive structure that had cast his family into the shadows.\nHis mother\u0026rsquo;s tired eyes reflected both worry and pride as Theo ventured deeper into the dangerous game of rebellion. Lily, his steadfast companion, stood by him, her commitment mirroring his own. Their father, though frail, possessed a newfound spark, fueled by the hope that Theo\u0026rsquo;s journey could change their fate.\nAs the resistance prepared for a pivotal strike against the immortal elite, Theo grappled with the gravity of his choices. The city, once a canvas of division, now bore witness to a brewing storm that threatened to shatter the illusion of invincibility cultivated by the privileged few.\nOn the eve of their daring mission, Theo stood at the precipice of destiny, ready to confront a world that had long denied the impoverished their right to thrive. The journey ahead promised not only to challenge the status quo but to redefine the very essence of life and death in a society divided by immortality.\nPage 4:\nThe night was thick with tension as the resistance assembled in the hidden recesses of the city. Theo\u0026rsquo;s heartbeat echoed the rhythmic pulse of rebellion. Clad in shadowy attire, the group moved with purpose, navigating the labyrinthine passages that led to the heart of the immortal elite\u0026rsquo;s stronghold.\nAs they approached the towering skyscrapers, the stark contrast between the glittering opulence and the desolate slums intensified. It was a visual manifestation of the disparity the resistance sought to dismantle. The cityscape seemed to hold its breath, anticipating the seismic shift that Theo and his companions aimed to unleash.\nRebecca, the indomitable leader, outlined the plan with precision. Infiltrating the inner sanctum of the elite required finesse and audacity. Theo, though a novice in the art of rebellion, felt a surge of determination coursing through his veins.\nScaling the imposing walls of the skyscraper, Theo\u0026rsquo;s hands gripped the cold metal, each movement a testament to the resilience born of a lifetime in poverty. The ascent mirrored his journey from the depths of destitution to the precipice of revolution.\nInside the heart of the immortal elite\u0026rsquo;s domain, Theo uncovered the unsettling truth. The secret to eternal life lay not in divine providence but in the manipulation of science and morality. The privileged few had harnessed the essence of life itself, relegating the masses to a realm of perpetual struggle.\nThe revelation fueled Theo\u0026rsquo;s resolve. He became a beacon of defiance, exposing the immoral underpinnings of a society built on the suffering of the many for the benefit of a select few. The city, once a symbol of division, now bore witness to the awakening of a collective consciousness, a realization that the fight for equality transcended individual aspirations.\nAs the resistance\u0026rsquo;s message spread like wildfire, Theo\u0026rsquo;s actions became a catalyst for change. The immortal elite, accustomed to the security of their eternal existence, trembled as the foundations of their power crumbled. The boy from the slums, once resigned to a life of hardship, emerged as an unexpected harbinger of justice.\nThe journey that began in the shadows of poverty now stood illuminated by the flickering flames of rebellion. Theo, propelled by the collective yearning for a better world, embraced his role as a catalyst for societal transformation. The city, no longer bound by the chains of immortality, witnessed the birth of a new era—one where the resilience of the impoverished could overcome the illusion of invincibility.\nChapter 1: The Divide\nIn the year 2145, a dystopian pallor draped the world, cloaking it in the shadows of an unsettling truth—immortality was a privilege hoarded by the elite. The city of Arcadia bore witness to this stark divide, its skyline a tale of two worlds: gleaming spires reaching for eternity and decaying slums festering in the despair of fleeting lives.\nAmidst the squalor of Arcadia\u0026rsquo;s forgotten districts lived Theo—a young soul navigating the harsh reality of a world that measured worth in the currency of time. Born into poverty, Theo\u0026rsquo;s world was a tapestry woven with threads of struggle and resilience. His family—his indomitable mother, Maya, his supportive sister, Lila, and his ailing father, David—clung to the fragile fabric of existence, a family tethered to mortality in a city intoxicated by immortality.\nAs the sun dipped below the luminous skyscrapers, casting long shadows over the slums, Theo\u0026rsquo;s family gathered in their meager dwelling. The air within, tinged with the scent of desperation, held the unspoken yearning for a chance at the perpetuity denied to those relegated to the shadows.\n\u0026ldquo;Father,\u0026rdquo; Theo\u0026rsquo;s sister, Lila, whispered, her voice laden with a mix of concern and hope, \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rsquo;ll find a way. The resistance whispers of possibilities beyond this oppressive reality.\u0026rdquo;\nDavid, weakened by the relentless march of time, nodded with a glimmer of longing in his eyes. His body bore the scars of a life marked by scarcity, and yet, his spirit harbored an insatiable hunger for the elixir of immortality that eluded them.\nThat evening, as the city slept beneath the watchful gaze of the immortal elite, Theo ventured into the labyrinthine alleys. Arcadia, a dichotomy of opulence and decay, sprawled before him. The glistening skyscrapers seemed to mock the crumbling structures that housed the struggling masses.\nIn the shadows, Theo stumbled upon a hidden enclave—the clandestine meeting place of the resistance. Figures draped in worn attire spoke of a rebellion brewing against the shackles of the immortality divide. Theo, drawn by the pulsating beat of dissent, found himself entangled in a dangerous dance that challenged the very fabric of the status quo.\nA figure emerged from the shadows, their face concealed by the cloak of rebellion. \u0026ldquo;We are the voices of the forgotten,\u0026rdquo; they declared, their words echoing through the dim enclave. \u0026ldquo;Arcadia may be divided, but the struggle for equality unites us.\u0026rdquo;\nTheo, fueled by the conviction of the resistance, felt a spark within—a spark that illuminated the path to challenge the celestial order. The divide between the immortal elite and the struggling masses would no longer be accepted as an immutable truth. As the night unfolded, Theo stood at the nexus of a perilous journey, his fate entwined with the resistance against the immortality divide—a journey that promised both danger and the tantalizing prospect of emancipation.\nIn the days that followed Theo\u0026rsquo;s initiation into the resistance, he found himself navigating a clandestine world woven with secrecy and rebellion. The resistance, a mosaic of diverse souls united by the common thread of discontent, unraveled the intricate web of immortality\u0026rsquo;s deception.\nTheo\u0026rsquo;s family, unbeknownst to them, became threads in the fabric of this rebellion. As he ventured deeper into the hidden recesses of Arcadia, Theo discovered the resilience etched into the stories of those who defied the immortal elite. Faces once obscured by shadows now emerged as comrades in the struggle for a future free from the chains of temporal disparity.\nHis sister, Lila, became Theo\u0026rsquo;s confidante in this dangerous dance against the status quo. The air in their dwelling, once thick with the stench of desperation, now shimmered with the possibility of change. Each whispered plan and coded message heightened the sense of anticipation, threading a narrative that challenged the very foundations of Arcadia\u0026rsquo;s oppressive reality.\nOne evening, beneath the flickering glow of a clandestine meeting, Theo encountered a charismatic figure within the resistance—a leader known as Seraphina. Cloaked in the symbols of rebellion, Seraphina\u0026rsquo;s voice resonated with unwavering conviction.\n\u0026ldquo;The immortal elite hoard eternity like kings on a throne,\u0026rdquo; she declared, her eyes aflame with fervor. \u0026ldquo;But we, the forgotten, shall rise. Arcadia\u0026rsquo;s spires may touch the heavens, but our collective will can shatter the illusion they cast.\u0026rdquo;\nSeraphina outlined a daring plan—an audacious attempt to breach the sanctums of the immortal elite and expose the truth to the world. As Theo listened, a quiet resolve blossomed within him. The struggle against the immortality divide was no longer an abstract concept; it was a call to action that echoed through the depths of his soul.\nAs the night wrapped Arcadia in its shroud, Theo returned to his family, his mind ablaze with newfound purpose. David, weakened by the unyielding grasp of time, looked at his son with a mixture of pride and longing.\n\u0026ldquo;Theo, my boy,\u0026rdquo; he uttered, his voice a fragile whisper, \u0026ldquo;if there\u0026rsquo;s a chance for your sister and me to see a world beyond the shadows, seize it. The pursuit of eternity is not just for the elite—it belongs to all who dare to dream.\u0026rdquo;\nTheo nodded, the weight of responsibility settling on his shoulders. The divide between the immortal elite and the struggling masses seemed insurmountable, yet within the hidden corridors of rebellion, he glimpsed the flicker of a different truth—an alternative reality where the pursuit of eternity could be a birthright for all.\nAs dawn approached, casting a hopeful glow over Arcadia\u0026rsquo;s skyline, Theo and his family stood at the threshold of a perilous journey. The resistance\u0026rsquo;s plan loomed on the horizon, promising both liberation and peril. The struggle against the immortality divide had transitioned from a clandestine murmur to a resounding declaration—the voices of the forgotten echoing through the city, challenging the very essence of a world where time itself had become a currency wielded by the privileged few.\nAs the days unfolded, Theo found himself immersed in the intricate dance of resistance. The clandestine meetings, shrouded in secrecy, became a nexus where disparate threads of discontent were woven into a collective tapestry of rebellion. Each whispered plan, every encoded message exchanged within the resistance, fueled the ember of defiance glowing within Theo\u0026rsquo;s heart.\nThe impending operation to breach the sanctums of the immortal elite hung in the air like a promise and a threat. Seraphina, the charismatic leader, became Theo\u0026rsquo;s guide through the clandestine labyrinth of Arcadia. She imparted the knowledge needed to navigate the city\u0026rsquo;s underbelly, revealing hidden passages and overlooked vulnerabilities in the seemingly impenetrable defenses of the immortal elite.\nTheo\u0026rsquo;s family, unknowingly at the center of this subversive storm, continued to face the harsh realities of their existence. David\u0026rsquo;s ailing condition intensified, his desperation for the chance at longevity etched into the lines of his weathered face. Lila, a beacon of support, held steadfast in her commitment to the cause.\nOne evening, as the moon cast its silvery glow over Arcadia, Theo and his family gathered for a quiet moment of reflection. The city\u0026rsquo;s skyline, a stark contrast of opulence and decay, served as a backdrop to their shared dreams and fears.\n\u0026ldquo;We stand at the precipice of change,\u0026rdquo; Lila mused, her gaze fixed on the gleaming spires that seemed to mock their struggles. \u0026ldquo;The resistance offers us a chance to defy the inevitability that\u0026rsquo;s defined our lives.\u0026rdquo;\nDavid, weakened but resolute, spoke with a father\u0026rsquo;s wisdom. \u0026ldquo;The pursuit of eternity is a perilous journey, my children. But if there\u0026rsquo;s a sliver of hope, seize it. The immortal elite may have the power of time, but we possess the strength of collective will.\u0026rdquo;\nIn the days leading to the operation, Theo\u0026rsquo;s training within the resistance intensified. Seraphina, recognizing his determination, bestowed upon him a critical role in the plan. The city\u0026rsquo;s intricacies unfolded before Theo like a chessboard, and each move held the weight of their rebellion.\nThe night of the operation arrived—a clandestine symphony echoing through the hidden corridors of Arcadia. Theo, clad in the symbols of resistance, stood with Seraphina and fellow comrades. As they approached the heart of the immortal elite\u0026rsquo;s stronghold, the air became charged with both anticipation and trepidation.\nTheo\u0026rsquo;s heart pounded in rhythm with the steps of rebellion. The divide between the privileged and the forgotten, symbolized by Arcadia\u0026rsquo;s towering spires, was about to be challenged. The city, ignorant of the impending upheaval, slept beneath the gaze of the immortal elite.\nAs they breached the sanctums, Theo and the resistance stood at the crossroads of destiny. The pursuit of eternity, once a distant dream, became a tangible reality within their grasp. The clash between the forgotten and the immortal elite loomed—a reckoning that would either shatter the illusion of eternal privilege or plunge Theo\u0026rsquo;s world into deeper shadows.\nThe first chapter of Theo\u0026rsquo;s journey had unfolded, a narrative of rebellion and defiance against a world that had consigned them to the harsh embrace of mortality. The city, a living testament to the immortality divide, awaited the outcome of this audacious endeavor—an endeavor fueled by the indomitable spirit of those who dared to challenge the unyielding order that bound time to the whims of the elite.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blogs/blog9/","title":"An Unfinished Story"},{"content":"\rCommunication Final Essay\nWhen asked about the definition of communication, many people are not aware of how much communication is in everything we do. Communication ranges from person to person and culture to culture but, at its core, it remains the same. We all have to communicate with each other. Even when we don’t speak, we are still communicating. As the phrase says, “actions speak louder than words.” Even when we don\u0026rsquo;t say anything, we can still “hear” what someone else says. Both our words and body language affect how we communicate. I think that the main definition of communication is: how we interact with one another in the world is based on the interactions from our previous experiences. This paper will expand on the knowledge of communication as a whole by showing the use of body language and how technology affects the way we communicate. The first main use of communication that doesn\u0026rsquo;t involve a person directly speaking with another is nonverbal communication. Nonverbal communication is a really important factor in how we process information from another person. A good example of this would be if someone says “I am fine”, but their facial expression clearly expresses that they are upset. Without nonverbal clues such as hand gestures, facial expressions, and how we overall present ourselves in a situation, we would not be able to clearly communicate with one another. Nonverbal communication is important because it helps us to see if something in someone\u0026rsquo;s speech lines up with the reactions of their body. It gives us a better understanding of a situation. The saying, “it\u0026rsquo;s not what you said but how you said it,” is important to this topic as it shows that our interactions with someone else has a lot to do with how we present the issue. “Nonverbal codes are messages consisting of symbols that are not words, including nonword vocalizations (pg. 72)”. This quote is an example that the non verbal language we use consists of gestures and other movements that we use in a certain context. This connects to the idea of communication as a “whole person.” Without seeing the other expressions and codes that we use, we wouldn’t fully understand or grasp what someone else was saying. Technology also plays an important role in human communication. In terms of historical human communication, technology is really new. Technology affects how we receive news, updates on important events, and even communicate with others online. Technology comes with its own barrier, as many people will say things online that they would never say in real life. Many people think that what they do online will have no effect on them and that there will not be real life consequences for their actions. Also, with the mass amount of technology we use, it opens the door to receive more information about what is going on in the world around us. For example, the Vietnam War was the first war that had ever been mediated/televised. The outlash that people had from what was happening started to put many people against it. Media has opened up a lot of opportunities to get information from around the world. Unfortunately, most of the news outlets only show bad press because it fear mongers the viewer into coming back. “Audiences do not want to hear from someone they do not trust or respect. They will not listen to or retain information from someone who has not earned the right to talk about that subject (pg.251).” People begin to gain trust with the media companies and news outlets that they frequently watch. Even if future information is skewed, people will continue to watch because of their previous trust of the outlet. My definition of communication that says “how we interact with one another is based on the interactions from our previous experiences” is a process. A process is something that is ever growing and changing. As we get older, our life experiences shape our perception of specific communication aspects. We will make assumptions, based on body language and facial expressions from our previous experiences, of someone’s actual feelings. The process that it takes to expand and grow our knowledge is not a short one. New forms of communication will continue to emerge. It\u0026rsquo;s a back and forth with one another to understand how each person feels and functions. The use of nonverbal communication, and the overall use of media, shapes the way in which we interact with one another. I believe that a lot of what we communicate is not all about what we say, it’s about how people perceive what we are saying. We need to continue to learn from new experiences to help us grow in our communication style with each other.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blogs/blog5/","title":"Communication"},{"content":"\rEnglish Literature Survey Hamlet Paper\nThroughout Kenneth Branagh’s movie Hamlet, Branaugh took many creative liberties in his interpretation of the book. Before we read Hamlet in class, I had already watched the Kenneth Branagh movie of Hamlet and read Hamlet two times prior so I had an overall general view of how I interpreted Hamlet. Before writing this, I rewatched the movie in order to refresh my memory as it had been some time since I last saw it. I forgot how good the movie is as I love the cast and the look of the characters. I also enjoy how they follow the book word for word and use the Shakespearean language. The way this movie shows itself makes me feel like I\u0026rsquo;m watching it on the stage back in Shakespeare\u0026rsquo;s time. As a student that is majoring in art, I love the way that they use each frame and how they make your attention focus on a certain thing. After watching it a second time, I saw things in those scenes that I didn’t notice the first time. The movie presents itself in a way that seems almost gloomy from the start. Most scenes are dark and it is sometimes hard to make out what is going on. But I feel that Kenneth Branagh does this for the purpose of making it feel like an older movie; as if we are watching something that took place in the past. With that being said, it also makes us feel like we are a part of the play with the characters sometimes breaking the 4th wall and talking to the audience. I know this was the original intent of the play as it was supposed to be played in front of a group of people but he didn’t necessarily have to do that. It also has a lot of moments where the characters talk to themselves in a way that isn’t directed toward the audience, but is said for the benefit of the audience. An example of this is the most famous Hamlet speech “To be, or not to be: that is the question:” (III.i.56). Instead of Hamlet looking at the audience in the main foyer room, he walks around talking to himself and then happens to look directly into the mirror that Polonius and Claudius are hiding behind. This shows the difference in the breaking of the 4th wall as he is no longer talking to the audience, but seems to be directing his speech toward other characters. Let’s take it back to the start of the movie. We start with the ghost of King Hamlet. In this scene, it starts with the guards out front hearing a wailing cry. This differs a little from the Shakespeare play as it mentions ghostly whispers instead. Another thing that Branagh uses creative freedom on is how the ghost appears and how it, more or less, startled the guards and created a horror element especially with the dark and gloomy night and mist in the area. This makes the overall feel of the castle a little more medieval and cold, especially with the high amounts of blue and gray tones within the scene. Another part that adds to this is the overall feeling that ghost Hamlet is supernatural as he just appears and starts “haunting” the castle. In the next scene we see the massive grand hall which adds a lot more color to the overall play and differs a lot from that of the first scene. In this scene Hamlet, the main character, who is dressed all in black due to the mourning of the death of his dad, stands out due to the amount and splash of color within the scene. We can also see by the cuts back and forth between the characters, their overall reaction to what is going on and the look on their face shows how they feel about the situation. This scene shows the overall dissatisfaction that Hamlet has with the situation of his father’s death and his mother’s remarriage and the lack of empathy from his mother. Her lack of empathy is apparent when she says “Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted color off,/And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark./Do not forever with thy vailed lids/Seek for thy noble father in the dust./Thou know’st ‘tis common; all that lives must die,/Passing through nature to eternity.” (I.ii.68-73).\nAs we go into scene III, we get to see a conversation between Laertes, Ophelia and Polonius. We can see that Laertes loves his sister and wants the best for her. He wants to try to keep her safe and we can see the slight fear in his face as he tells her to be careful of Hamlet. We can also see Polonius and his overbearing fatherly appearance as he tries to control the situation. However, the movie makes Polonius feel like a bit of a comic relief. His character just seems like someone you can laugh at. Even though they can both seem bossy and overbearing toward Ophelia, Laertes and Polonius both care for her and they have a nice family get together moment in the play (the first and the last family reunion). In the movie, Ophelia seems very vulnerable because, while she is an adult, she is portrayed in a very childish manner. As we go into scene IV, we get to see the ghost of Hamlet’s dad again. In the movie, we get to see Hamlet chase the ghost through the woods. This is made even more dramatic by the creative tactics of the eerie lights that flash and the intense music that plays. The way the movie shows Hamlet’s actions makes it seem very “in the moment” and the close up of their faces really captures Hamlet’s fear in the moment. As we go into Scene V, the ghost tells Hamlet how he was murdered by Claudius. In this moment, the ghost is portrayed as a supernatural force that appears in an almost hellish style. From watching the movie and how the ghost appears, Branagh makes the ghost feel like some demon or haunted spirit as the ghost appears to be in some sort of pain. The addition of the lightning adds a fear-like factor to the overall scene. Now as we enter Act II scene I we get to see Polonius talking with Reynaldo. We really get to see Polonius as a manipulator. He starts to manipulate the people around him in order to get what he wants. He tells Reynaldo to go spy on his son and spread rumors about him just to see if they might be true. We also get to see a taste of Hamlet\u0026rsquo;s madness in the movie. We see that Opheila has a flashback to what happened between the two of them and it shows a very dramatic moment that is almost unsettling to watch. In the next scene II we see Claudius and Gertrude summon Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. They, as Polonius wants Reynaldo to do, want them to spy on Hamlet for them. We can see their inner struggle since Hamlet is their best friend, but they have no choice but to comply because of their loyalty to the crown. Next Polonius goes to the king and tells him that Hamlet is going mad and it is because he is in love with Polonius’ daughter, Ophelia. His proof is a love letter that Hamlet wrote to Ophelia. In the movie, Polonuis reads the letter in an overly dramatic fashion, emphasizing certain words to convince the king of Hamlet’s madness. This is another way that Polonius uses his slight manipulation to change the story so others will agree with him. We then get to see Polonius and Hamlet together in the courtyard where Hamlet pretty much antagonizes Polonius the entire time, even calling him a “Fishmonger” which represents a low class person. We see that Hamlet starts to appear more mad and that he also doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be in touch with reality. Hamlet is then approached by Rozencrantz and Guildenstern who wanted to check up on Hamlet. Hamlet quickly catches onto their motives: that they were sent by the King. In the movie, Hamlet’s facial expressions show the audience that he is clearly aware of their true intentions. He does not think they would have come to check on him on their own accord. Finally, the Players arrive and Hamlet goes to greet them. Hamlet has a plan to have the Players perform a play that involves a similar reenactment of his father’s death as told by the ghost. He wants to see Claudius’ reaction to determine whether or not he believes that Claudius killed his father. For Act III Scene I we get to go back into the grand hall where Claudius and Polonius are trying to use Ophelia as bait to prove that Hamlet is mad because of his love for her. In the movie, they hide behind a two way mirror which uses a lot of creative freedom because, in the play, it just says they hide behind a tapestry. What really adds onto this scene in the movie is as Hamlet is giving his most famous speech he stares directly into the mirror. He can’t see them, but this creates an epic but intense moment as the two men are in fear that they might be caught. They feel like he is looking right at them. The way that they also get really close to each other while hiding also creates a funny moment between the characters. As Ophelia enters we get to see a lot of emotions on all of the characters’ faces and how they really feel. Hamlet states to Ophelia “If thou dost marry, I’ll give thee this plague/for thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as/snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a/nunnery. Go, farwell” (III.i.136-139). This line clearly shows that Hamlet is not “love sick” for Ophelia. In scene II we see Hamlet set up his trap for Claudius with the play. As the play goes on we get to watch the reactions to each character and how they feel in that moment. I think something the movie does well is the close-ups on the faces of Hamlet and Claudius and seeing the panic in one and the almost joy from the other. We can also see when Claudius gets up and leaves the room how everything becomes silent and this confirms Hamlet’s suspicion and that the ghost was telling the truth. In scene III we see Claudius starting to repent something. The movie puts Claudius in a repenting box that allows the dark environment to close around him, but still light up his face. He seems to be genuinely repenting at first, but then he clearly states he would do it again and is not sorry. However, Hamlet thinks he is repenting so he can’t kill him due to their beliefs. This scene shows that Hamlet is so close to killing Claudius, knowing he could just shove the knife in there, but he doesn’t and we know he is only prolonging the inevitable. In scene 4 we get some creative freedom as Hamlet enters his mothers room in order to comfort her about what Claudius did to Old Hamlet. In this, we get to see a lot of emotions from the characters and it really makes you feel bad for Hamlet even though he is yelling most of the time. Hamlet hears rustling coming from a tapestry and thinks it’s Claudius so he plunges a knife through it and kills the person. Hamlet seems even more crazy when he finds out it was actually Polonius that he killed. He nonchalantly insinuates that he shouldn’t have been eavesdropping and Hamlet and his mother continue the conversation. Branagh creates an almost funny moment because it feels so random and sudden the way they just continue to talk like nothing happened. I also think this scene is odd because we get to see the ghost again but only Hamlet can see the ghost and his mother can not. Perhaps this is an indication that he is truly mad. As we roll into Act IV Gertrude talks to Claudius about what Hamlet did and we get to see her be shaken by the event that occurred. We also get to see the panic in Claudius’ face as he knows he will be next if he doesn’t do something about Hamlet. This really adds to the play as we get their visual representation of how they feel and their “oh no” face. We also see how he manipulates Gertrude again by giving her reassurance but also how to keep his own power on the throne. In Scene II and III people start questioning Hamlet about where he put Polonius’ body and he creates this trail of riddles while also going on this massive running spree around the castle. I think this scene is done really well as he runs around faster, almost feeling like a weird dream. It shows how his actions have affected him causing him to run away faster as his problems slowly catch up to him. Claudius has a plan to ship Hamlet off to England and secretly have him assassinated. Their conversation gets heated and the movie does a good job of showing the buildup of tension between the two. In Scene IV we get to see Hamlet run into one of Fortinbras’s army platoons, coming to kill old King Hamlet. We can see part of Fortinbras’s incoming army and from the way the shot is angled, we have this nice snowy backdrop with the army ever-approaching. This shot shows us the craziness of this situation as they are marching in the snow to attack a king that has already been killed. The soliloquy that Hamlet gives “How all occasions do inform against me/And spur my dull revenge!” (IV.iv.32-33) shows how he is slowly ready to embrace action and actually do something. We can see from the imposing army and Hamlet\u0026rsquo;s personal struggle with killing the king Claudius, that he finally may know what he wants to do and be ready to attack. In scene V, we can see Ophelia slowly going into madness from the death of her father. These scenes are done really well as she is portrayed as a lost child; singing creepy-sounding sounds. The way the scene is framed really gives it a slight horror element. We can see how vulnerable Ophelia actually is and this grief from the death of her dad puts her over the line. We also see Laertes come back from his trip to France and learns about the death of his dad. Branagh does this scene with him coming back with an armed group that shows that Laertes is planning a threat against Claudius’ rule. We can also see Claudius’ master manipulation skills as he uses it against Laertes. In scene VI Horatio receives the letter from Hamlet about his escape from his ship to England and his trip back to Denmark. We can tell from the quick cuts back and forth in the movie that there is much urgency in this letter and we can tell Hamlet is only bringing chaos back with him. In scene VII, Claudius convinces Laertes to kill Hamlet. We can tell that Laertes is angry over the death of his father and the “accidental” death of his sister and this has clouded his judgment. He thinks someone needs to pay for what happened and that someone is Hamlet. Act V scene I, we get to see the gravedigger for the first time. Even though he doesn’t get much screen time, one of the most important parts of the movie happen here. The gravedigger adds a nice sense of humor with a dark and very gray tone cemetery. The film could do better to lighten this area up. Yes, it’s supposed to be dark but at the same time it’s hard to see what is going on at some points. In this scene we can also see an open grave which seems like a foreshadowing of what is yet to come, that one of the characters may end up there. We can see when Hamlet grabs Yorick’s skull that he knew who it was. We can see this by the flashbacks and close ups that the director gives us. In the movie, this part almost gets too personal as it appears that Hamlet is going to cry, showing us for the first time his vulnerable self. We also have to ask if Hamlet has gone out of his madness and I believe that he has but it was only from his time out of Denmark that made that possible. Scene II, the final scene in the play was done really well. First, we see Hamlet going back over the story that he had sent to Horatio and, from the telling, I don’t think he regrets what he did. We can tell by the story and how everyone just seems to accept it that the world at which they live in is crazy. He then starts the duel that was proposed to him by Laertes. The tension is slowly built up because as the audience, we know what their plan is, as they slowly get ready for this fight. The fight then begins and it is fast-paced as they are both trying to hit each other. The camera cuts around and shows the swords that hit each other. We can see on both of their faces the growing intensity of whoever is going to land the first blow. Hamlet won the duel and Gertrude took the first drink from a poisoned glass that was meant for Hamlet. She dies and we can see Hamlet\u0026rsquo;s grief when the camera cuts back to him. Both Hamlet and Laertes end up getting stabbed with Laertes poisonous blade. Hamlet is so upset about his mother’s death that he runs up to the king, stabs him multiple times with the poisonous blade and forces him to drink the poisonous drink. I think this is especially brutal and almost scary how Hamlet does this but it shows that Hamlet has finally made up his mind to commit the murder he had planned all along. I think this movie ends really well with the zoom out of the castle and Hamlet being carried out. We also get to see the full pan of the castle with Fortinbras\u0026rsquo;s army pulling up and the surroundings on fire. This creates a really cool ending to the movie and leaves us wondering who will rule Denmark next. Overall, I think the movie does really well at showing the story of Hamlet and I believe that it does a really good job at showing a visual interpretation of what happened while still following the play word-for word. It is a long movie but I believe it does really well to keep up the entertainment and keep it moving with barely any boring parts. I feel this film portrayed the play exactly as it should be. After I watched the Kenneth Branagh movie, I feel like the other Hamlet movies do not stick as closely to the original dialogue of the play.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blogs/blog3/","title":"Comparing Hamlet"},{"content":"\rPaper Yeats, Easter 1916\nI chose to write about Yeats, Easter 1916. There was no real purpose behind this choice other than I liked the name of it and I wanted to make a prediction of what the poem is about. The only thing I have read so far is the title and the footnote on the title. Judging by what the two of those said, I could already tell that this poem was not going to be filled with happiness, candy and Easter bunnies like that of our Easters today. This poem is going to be more dreary and about the rebellion that took place on that day. Yeats could change the poem\u0026rsquo;s feeling, depending on what side and stance he has taken. It depends on whether he was for the idea of the rebellion or against it. After reading the poem and going through each line one by one and translating it to simple English, it is clear that Yeats cared about these leaders that fought in the rebellion against British rule. He believed that they are the people who would and did invoke change. But he also wonders if they really had to die for what they did. Was their death worth the results in which they produced? These are a few of the questions he asks throughout the poem. It all starts with the first line of the poem “I have met them at close of day”(Line 1 Pg. 1834). He starts by talking about how he met these people at the end of the day which refers to two things: “them” refers to the rebellion leaders that he probably met with and close of day refers to their deaths and executions. He sees them with these powerful expressions on their faces as they come from just everyday walks of life. He uses “counter or desk”(Line 3 Pg. 1834) to expand that they are just normal people. He would pass them with a nod of his head to be polite. These people which he saw lead the rebellion were just normal people that existed on the street. He continued to recognize how they were no different than anyone else. We can also see the narrator\u0026rsquo;s involvement. Even before he was done talking to them he would think “Of a mocking tale or a gibe” (Line 10 Pg. 1834). He didn’t really recognize them as anything special; he would mock them and tell the jokes to his friends. But soon, everything changed as he says “A terrible beauty is born”(Line 16 Pg. 1834). I believe this line means a few different things. Something that is bad, like war, can take place. But it can also bring up a new kind of beauty such as overthrowing a corrupt political figure. It leads to wars and death of some people but it could also be for the greater good of everyone. This is one of those necessary evils that occur. In the second stanza, it starts and represents a type of backstory for the people that lead the rebellion. He starts off by explaining the first person to us. This is one of the first rebel leaders that helped out. Unfortunately, upon reading further on and from the notes at the bottom of the page, we can figure that everyone that the narrator mentions in this poem dies in one way or another. He talks about a woman that spent way too much time trying to help for a reason that was unknown. She spent her nights in arguments with others until she couldn’t speak anymore. This points to a later fact within the poem that leads back to the main question, is the fight worth it? There was no voice better than her and she was young and beautiful but yet she rode to harriers. I believe the use of harriers can be used in two different ways here. One way that it can be used is as a place that she is actually riding to but, it can also be used as a hunting term as if she rides to hunt down hares. The narrator uses this term in a way as if she hunts down the enemies like they were bunnies that needed to be preyed upon. He next talks about “This man”(Line 24 Pg. 1834) who owned a school and kept up with it who rode our winged horse. This refers to the person that would lead the charge and be the “captain” of the rebellion at least in the poetic sense as the winged horse is a Pegasus. The narrator then goes on to talk about this other man that was a helper to him and a friend. These two men which are referred to by name later in the poem could have made it big, especially MacDonagh. He was very sensitive but yet courageous and sweet in his mind. The way the narrator describes these last three that were just mentioned makes them feel like heroes in some way or another. This answers one of the questions that Yeats is, in fact, on the side of the rebellion or he at least thinks what they did had some meaningful impact or else he would have written them in a darker light. After those three men, he mentions one last man within this stanza which he sees as a drunk that was aggressive to people and hurts the ones that he cares about. We can see that what he says “Yet I number him in the song”(Line 35 Pg. 1834) shows that he didn’t like the man very much but includes him in this poem anyway because, at the end of the day, he did his part in the rebellion. After line 35 in this poem we can see how the mood shifts. It starts off as who cares about all this and what\u0026rsquo;s going on in life is just a joke anyway. It moves toward the remembrance of these people and an ode to them but then he mentions about how even the person he doesn’t like still dies anyway. He refers to this as a “casual comedy”(Line 37 Pg. 1834). This creates a sense of disassociation with the real world as if he is watching the acts in a play take place. Even with the realization of these people that fought in the rebellion all dying he realizes that they all created a new form of change. He ends this stanza in the same way that he ends the first stanza saying “A terrible beauty is born”(Line 40 Pg. 1834) but, this line feels like it could mean they died but they are creating a better world and a better tomorrow. This next stanza he starts with saying “Hearts with one purpose alone”(Line 41 Pg. 1834). This shows us that the people he mentioned before had one goal in mind and that through every season they carried this goal. Unfortunately, they carried this to be like a stone that can’t leave this ever flowing stream. He talks about a horse that comes from the road and a bird that flies on the open range, even a cloud that is tumbling through all of these changes every minute. Yet, the people he talks about are like the stone and cannot change. He talks about a horse that slides into a creek or a chicken that dives and does a mating call and every second they live. This stanza uses a lot of comparing real life things to that of the people. He talks about how all these things can change and live but yet since the people that took place in this rebellion are all dead they are like the stones being able to watch and see what their work unfolded into without actually being there. We can infer this represents his belief that there is a god especially with a line said in the next stanza. He starts off by getting even more of a depressed tone in each of the stanzas by saying “Too long a sacrifice”(Line 57 Pg. 1834). This starts to slowly answer the question: does he think it was worth what the people did? Well, judging by the first lines he asks, does that sacrifice make the heart turn into stone? This jumps back to the previous stanza where he almost describes what the stone is and how it is unchanging. But with those questions he says that only heaven and God will know if what they did was worth it or not. Their goal is to remember the names of the people that fought in this rebellion just like a mother would for her child and when sleep had come at last and that childs energy and wildness have all gone away. Yet , he asked the question “What is it but nightfall?”(Line 65 Pg. 1834). Well in this part he refers to nightfall and sleep as if it was death meaning that death is really just a peaceful sleep and is that of nightfall just the beginning to that sleep. Yeats then answers that question and says NO, it is not a sleep but the death of the people. Was death necessary? Yeats half answers this question by saying England will keep its promise to grant Home Rule to Ireland, for what that is worth. However, we know their dream will live on either way since we know what they fought for. He then starts to wrap up the poem by saying the people that dreamed this are all now dead, but we will remember them for their dream. He writes this to remember MacDonagh, MacBride, Connolly, and Pearse. That anytime that green is worn it will be a remembrance of them and with that it brought the change “A terrible beauty is born”(Line 80 Pg. 1835). Overall this poem, just by the name alone, is not what I thought it would be. But, after closely reading it and breaking it down more simply, it makes a lot of sense and actually turns out to be a good poem. The message that these people did things to incite change and died for it creates a martyr effect which makes for a very interesting poem. It felt like reading a historical text since these were true events that occurred. The text makes sense for its time as this was the start of wars breaking out and the narrator agrees and disagrees with the wars that are taking place. That\u0026rsquo;s why, at the beginning, it felt as if he was just a watcher but he got more and more involved throughout the poem. He also wrote this poem as an ode to the people who died in this rebellion. He wants to remember them, that\u0026rsquo;s why they are drawn in a hero type of light. For the end of this close reading, I wanted to write the poem in as simple words as possible so it was easier to understand. I also used this to help as my guide for when writing about the poem. At the end of day I have met people from all walks of life among these gray houses. I passed them with a nod or some small talk and while I did I thought of a joke to tell my friend around the fireplace at the club. Then suddenly everything changed for better or worse. The Woman’s days were spent innocently but her nights were spent arguing in favor of the rebellion. What voice is better than a beautiful young voice who is speaking on behalf of the rebellion? A man owned a school and led the charge, another man was his helper and friend who came to his aid. They, too, were part of the rebellion and the woman would go to the school to help in the planning of the rebellion under the guise of hare hunting. Another man, who was part of the rebellion, was a drunk, vain and aggressive man who did a lot wrong to people whom Yeats held dear. However, this man did his part in the rebellion and died as a result so he warrants a mention and recognition in the poem. He was changed in this rising for better or worse. People with one purpose all year round can seem like a stone stuck in a stream. The horse and its rider, the birds that fly, and from cloud to cloud, all change. A shadow of a cloud changes on the ground every minute. A horse that slides into a creek makes a horse strike within. The birds dive and they do their mating calls every minute they live. But stone sees it all. A goal that takes too long can make someone\u0026rsquo;s heart turn to stone. How many will be enough? That\u0026rsquo;s God\u0026rsquo;s job, our job is to repeat name upon name, as a mother calls her child until they fall asleep after being wild. What is it but sleep? No, not sleep but death. Was it wasteful deaths? England may have kept their promise after all this had been done. We know the rebels dream. Enough to know that they are dead. What if they clouded their judgement till their death? I write out their names MacDonagh, MacBride, Connolly, and Pearse. You will be honored everytime green is worn. Everything has changed for better or worse.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blogs/blog4/","title":"Easter 1916, Yeats Paper"},{"content":"\rThe second problem we are going to look at is from the chapter 3 homework\rBean counting\rYou can get the Nth character, or letter, from a string by writing [N] after the string (for example, string[2]).

Are we humans fundamentally good or are we inherently evil? Many ancient Chinese philosophers tried to answer this question, some with opposing beliefs. The main two beliefs were that of Mencius, who believed that human nature was naturally and fundamentally good, and Hsun Tzu, who believed that humans were inherently evil. Who is right? Well, Mencius’s theory of human nature is extremely convincing because it sheds light on the difficult problem of whether humanity is fundamentally good or evil. During the time period of 300 B.C. in ancient China, Confucianism was on the rise. This is the belief that love and compassion are the two greatest virtues of life and that a community that followed this would end up prospering. With this, it was also believed that nature was a part of one\u0026rsquo;s soul and that everything someone did was parallel with something in nature. This causes Mencius’s unique argument style which uses a lot of analogies with nature. With this argument style, he tries to convince his audience that human nature is one with nature and the belief is that nature is good. This follows the teaching of the philosopher Confucius, who founded the religion. Mencius\u0026rsquo; first belief is that human nature is like that of wood and water; it is inherently good unless it is shaped by an outside force. He talks with Gaozi, a fellow philosopher, who believes that human nature is a blank slate and starts off as neither good nor evil. During this conversation, Gaozi uses the example of the willow tree. It starts off naturally as wood; neither good nor evil, but it can be chopped down to make cups and bowls. Mencius argues “Can you make cups and bowls from willow wood by following its natural grain or is it only after you have hacked the willow wood that you can make a cup or bowl?”(Mencius Section 1 Paragraph 2). Mencius\u0026rsquo; point is that human nature is a part of nature and the willow tree does not naturally turn into a cup or a bowl; only when the human acts on it to alter it from its natural state does it become changed. This aligns with Mencius\u0026rsquo;s belief that the nature of things are good until they are molded by an outside force to become bad. Gaozi then goes on to talk about water at a spring and how water does not make a distinction of where it is going; it will flow east or west as it pleases. There is nothing good nor evil in its intention. Mencius counters this with the statement, “The good disposition of human nature is like water\u0026rsquo;s tendency to flow down”(Mencius Section 2 Paragraph 2). His point is that water does not care what direction east or west it goes, but it does naturally flow down. As the water flows, it encounters outside forces that can cause it to splash and turn off course. Just like that of human nature; it is natural to be good and follow the correct path, but there are outside forces that can interact with the human that can cause them to veer off course and take a path that is not in the interest of good. Mencius also uses the analogy that humans are like seeds. Every seed is planted with the intention of growing into a full and healthy plant; just as humans are born with a natural plan to live a full, healthy and positive life. Mencius says, “All men possess a sense of commiseration; all men possess a sense of shame; all men possess a sense of respect; all men possess a sense of right and wrong” (Mencius section 6 paragraph 1). These human attributes each relate to a seed. With the proper care and attention, these positive traits will continue to grow and prosper; just as a properly cared for plant will thrive in nature. He goes on to say, “In years when the harvests have been good, most young men are compliant; in years when the harvests fail most are vicious” (Mencius section 7 Paragraph 1). It is easy for humans to make the right decision when life is easy and there is no threat to their existence. However, when times become bad and food is scarce, the human can become very selfish and aggressive in his attempt to save himself. The nature of humans depends on the nature around them; when nature is good to them, it is easy to be good. When nature is bad to them, humans become evil against their fellow humans. Nature and humans are on a parallel path. Just as a watered seed will prosper, a cared for human will be a positive person. Just as an abandoned seed will die, a neglected human will become a negative person; caring only about their own survival. Mencius says, “Seek for it and you will get it; let it go and you will lose it” (Mencius section 6 Paragraph 1). Mencius believed that humans are born with a sense of humanity, righteousness, ritual and wisdom; all which are good attributes. These traits are not something that the human has to learn or think consciously about. However, outside influences can greatly affect the path that the human takes. Humans must continue to seek the right path, even when faced with adversity. Letting go of their innate goodness is what makes a human become evil.\nFinally, Mencius uses the analogy of the Ox Mountain and the life that used to live there. He explains by saying “There once was a time when the woods of Ox Mountain were lovely. But because they lay close beside the capital of a great state, the ax and adze hacked away at them - could they remain lovely long? ”(Mencius Section 8 Paragraph 1). Naturally, the Ox Mountain was lovely. It would’ve continued to be lovely if it had been left alone to live as it was meant to live. However, it was acted upon by an outside force; the human. They chopped down the trees for wood and let their cattle and sheep graze on the grasses. The lush mountain became barren. He makes the point that people who see the mountain is barren cannot assume it was always barren because that’s not how a natural mountain exists. He relates this to humans; humans are naturally made to be good and pure. However, outside forces can act so negatively on a human that it is hard to believe that human was ever good. Mencius says “There is nothing that does not grow when it receives its proper nourishment, and there is nothing that does not shrivel when it loses what it was nourished by”(Mencius Section 8 Paragraph 3). Like a human child that loses their parents, they lose the love and nourishment that they need in order to thrive and remain righteous. Once this is lost, it is easy to turn down a negative path and can be impossible to correct. Once good it is corrupted by evil, it is almost always lost. Some people, who believe Hsun Tzu’s philosophy, may say that the good of humans is actually just the result of conscious thought and that we all start out evil. This could be true since humans do bad things that we should not do to each other, even as children. However, if that is true, why do we see babies as innocent? Why do we find them so cute as if they could do no wrong? Is that the result of conscious activity? If it was truly conscious activity that makes us good, then what about the animal kingdom? If the nature of animals and plants are parallel with that of people, what makes them good and bad? We see dogs and cats as good since they are our pets. But we see bears, spiders, snakes, and other dangerous animals as bad. However, it is our conscious activity that forms this difference. Surely, we cannot assume that a bear is evil for killing fish to feed its babies or killing a human who invades their space and appears to be a threat. Animals do not have conscious activity in their brains to make rational decisions so they are just following the natural way they were born. Therefore, if nature is not naturally evil, humans cannot be. It is the conscious activity and the circumstances which surround a human that leads to the path of evil.\nOverall, Mencius believes that humans are fundamentally good from birth and that parallel with nature directly shows that the world is fundamentally good. Just as wood and water can be warped to become something it\u0026rsquo;s not, the human experience can shape their overall nature. Whether it is a positive or negative experience will affect the attitude of the human. Mencius sees the good in all humans and he realizes that their upbringing affects their overall nature; hence the nature versus nurture view. It is the experience of each individual human that ultimately makes them good or evil.\nWorks Cited Weiming, Tu. “Confucianism | Meaning, History, Beliefs, \u0026amp; Facts.” Britannica, 17 August 2023, https://www.britannica.com/topic/Confucianism.

Judith Jarvis Thomson proposes a few different situations and their overall moral value of what is right and wrong. The theory of the difference is killing or letting die. The scenario involves a runaway trolley heading towards five people who are tied to the tracks (918). You are standing next to a lever that can divert the trolley onto a track where there is only one person tied (918). The question is: should you pull the lever to redirect the trolley, sacrificing one person to save five (918)? This is the first problem we are faced with and most people would agree to divert the track in order to kill the one and save the five (918). She then presents the transplant scenario: you are a surgeon with five patients who need organ transplants to survive, and there is only one available donor who is healthy and can provide all the necessary organs (918). The donor is a healthy individual who happens to be in your hospital for a routine check-up, but unfortunately, the donor is perfectly healthy but happens to match the five patients perfectly in terms of blood type and organ compatibility (918). This proposes the opposite result where most people would save the one and kill the five but what\u0026rsquo;s different in this situation then that of the trolley problem. The real difference is killing and letting die in the trolley problem (921). All people are already involved in the situation and there\u0026rsquo;s nothing you can do so you are just trying to minimize damage by letting the one die. In the transplant scenario you would be violating that one person\u0026rsquo;s rights and killing them. So in turn you would let the five die because you are just letting them die. In the Loop Variant, the scenario is similar to the Trolley Problem but with a twist: The trolley track forms a loop. If you pull the lever to divert the trolley, it will still hit one person on the alternate track, but then the trolley will loop around and continue its course, running over the five people on the main track. However, there is a person on the side track who is large enough to stop the trolley and prevent it from continuing down the loop, saving the five people. This then brings up the Fat Man thought experiment (926). Here you are faced with a trolley hurtling toward five people. However, instead of a lever, the only way to stop the trolley is to push a large person (the \u0026ldquo;Fat Man\u0026rdquo;) in front of the trolley. The Fat Man is large enough that his body will stop the trolley, therefore saving the five people (926). Overall the main concern of the trolley problem and the ethical dilemma that it presents is do we allow people to die or do we kill them but in order to save more.\nWorks Cited Thompson Judith Jarvis,”the trolley problem” Ethics: History, Theory and Contemporary Issues, 7th Edition.

This was performed by college professors from Ionian University in Greece. They performed this for us as part of a cross cultural exchange program where the University of Kentucky teachers performed in Greece. Overall I thought the music was very interesting as it has a slightly different sound then something that is more american. Although I could not understand any of the songs due to a language barrier I still enjoyed and listened to them. I also enjoyed this concert because it was close to home so I did not have to travel too far as well as there was not a ticket price and anyone could show up. There were about 100 or so people in this big auditorium and the feeling was more formal as if I went to an opera. There were quite a few acts and I enjoyed the difference in music. One thing that I didn\u0026rsquo;t like is how odd some of the songs were, especially the ones they started playing near the end. Most of the songs towards the end felt more sad and repetitive then the ones they played in the beginning. One thing I really enjoyed was the violinist named Spyros Gkikontis as he performed really well and moved his body with the music making it feel really lively. The concert was performed with many different instruments like a piano, violin, trumpet, cello, trombone, flugelhorn, horn, tuba, guitar, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, saxophone, and drums. One thing I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect is the vocal range of the singers and their ability to hold such a high note as I know I could not hold such a smooth note like they did. The first musical song I liked was Recitativo and Scherzo Caprice with the violinist Spyros Gkikontis. He did a really good job with this song and lightened the entire mood of the auditorium. You could also tell that he really enjoyed playing the instrument as he would move around the stage and stomp his feet to get this deeper sound. He also used the bow for the violin really well as he made many different sounds with the strings from long notes to very short bursts by using string tapping to get the sound that he desired. The overall song felt more upbeat and joyous then other songs and even some people in the audience were surprised. It was honestly a very impressive piece with a fast tempo. It\u0026rsquo;s not a song I would have normally listened to as it did not follow the “American” type of music but overall it was probably my favorite performance in the entire show. The song is from Greece and music that they listen to there although the songs meaning i\u0026rsquo;m not 100% sure on it did make me feel in that certain upbeat way. The next songs that I liked all fell within one category and that was the children\u0026rsquo;s song named Eight children’s miniatures for piano. The list of the eight songs were Prelude, March, Whistles, Little song out of tune, Counia Bella, The Wolf and the little red riding hood, Mister Tinky, and Lullaby. It was played by a solo pianist named Athina Fytika. She did a good job overall playing the piano but I felt like these songs were just not what I originally thought they were. The songs felt more creepy and almost like they would be in a horror movie and not so much meant for children. One of the songs she played pretty much sounded like the Michael Myers theme song when he\u0026rsquo;s near. It may have been one of the cultural divides that happens with music but it all had an underlying sad sound. Another thing I didn\u0026rsquo;t like was the overall sound that she made on the piano. Most of the songs felt very slow and not upbeat in the slightest but with that it kinda felt like she was just hitting keys on the piano. I figured that the songs were just supposed to sound that way since she played other songs and they sounded good but the childrens songs were just not good in my opinion. The last song I liked that I want to write about is Cinq Melodies populaires grecques. It was played by a piano and a mezzo soprano singer named Rosa Poulimenou. This was also a coordination of what sounded to be a few different songs as they did not flow well with each other; the mezzo soprano’s voice was much lower than that of the other soprano that played earlier. This singer sang with a lot of emotion in her voice as I could feel the words that she sang and feel a way about each and every word she said. I did not understand the song due to it being in italian but it still felt like each syllable rang through the audience. She had such a pronounced voice and when she hit the high notes it rang through the auditorium. She did a really good job at expressing her voice and how the song was supposed to make you feel. The music with her vocals made the music way more enjoyable as it acted as another voice to grasp onto. The only thing I didn\u0026rsquo;t like is it felt like an opera and I\u0026rsquo;m not the biggest fan of opera music but nonetheless it was still a good performance. All in all I enjoyed the performance and thought they did a really good job at setting everything up. Even though the music that they played was much different then the style of music that I like, it still was overall a good show. I enjoyed the way that the singers and musicians presented themselves and moved to the music. Even though there was no actual dancing to the music the beats still moved through the performers. It did meet my expectations and was a good time to go to even if it wasn’t fully my thing. The venue was nice,being on UK campus grounds and I would do it again sometime.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blogs/blog8/","title":"The UK Global Gala"},{"content":"About Me\rI’m Tyler Spears, and I’m 20 years old.

The reason that I picked this theme was for two main reasons. Number one it is way simpler then that of the previous theme i was using which is blowfish. This site has a nice clean element to it that blowfish didn’t have and there are less moving parts. It was still difficult to set up and took some time to do so but after I got the hang of it the site setup became a lot easier. The second reason I like this theme is because it offers the option for dark mod which I just have a strange liking to and wish every site had that option. Other than those two things this site works similar to that of blowfish and other themes I have used. It uses CSS and HTML in order to style the page but this is where the actual enhancements come into play. The first thing that I decided to do was to make all the pages consistent. This is where I went into Canva and I started to make my own banners. The making of my own banners gave the site a more personal touch and not so much of a carbon copy site template. The next thing that I decided to do was add the main top navigation bar that allows users to move from one page topic to another. With that I also added the articles and the blogs to the home page. This for one makes the home page feel more filled with life but also allows the user to see recent blog posts and articles and topics like this one. I also wanted to make my blogs more fluid and feel like you can move between them easier so I added a back to blogs button at the top and I added a button that takes you back to the top of the page this allows for easier site navigation and for the users ease of use. The next thing I added was the use of categories that allows the user to now search categories by tags and types rather than going through the whole list. There also exists a search bar at the top of the main navigation that allows the user to type in certain words and find them in the blogs and articles. This allows the user to search for things particular to them so for instance if the user types in hamlet into the search it will bring up the blog that relates to that. Most of the enhancements were done by me and the structure and placement were as well but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean no AI was used for more information on this go to the other article page about AI or for ease of use click right HERE. This is most of the enhancements that I made to the site in order to make it function and to look good.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/articles/page3/","title":"Enhancment of Site"},{"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/articles/page2/","title":"My First article Post"},{"content":"The use of AI comes in very handy throughout the process of the site creation mostly in troubleshooting and fixing simple errors. Unfortunately I am broke and just use the free version of ChatGPT which you don\u0026rsquo;t have to log into so it doesn\u0026rsquo;t save any of your chat information but I\u0026rsquo;m here to tell you everything it did and what it helped me with. Starting off AI is a good and helpful tool for the use of site creation but at the same time I feel that it can harm the student who uses it if they rely on it too much. This is why I try to limit the use of AI and how much I depend on it. This being said, I still use AI to a good degree. I used ChatGPT to help me with all of the following things said below. First was getting the hugo site up in running. I tried a few different Hugo themes but could not seem to get any of them to work, which I found strange because I got the blowfish theme up and running a lot easier than the Vortisil theme that I currently have. So in my time of need trying to find a new theme that would work I went to ChatGPT. Unfortunately this even stumped AI for a little bit as I kept trying to get the site to work and it gave me advice and still nothing after a bit of doing this I would give up and move onto the next theme. AI doesnt know how to set up the hugo theme sites directly so it needs a lot of guidance in order to reach a functional site state after a while of trying on different themes i believe that i taught it enough that it finally got the theme to work. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t pretty and the site barely functioned but at least I wasn\u0026rsquo;t getting an error. This was just the beginning. After that I messed around with all the site settings, figured out what edited what and then finally began my process. For the most part the setup was not very hard and using the TOML front matter was very easy as it was similar to that of the blowfish theme. After the setup of the site in its most basic form i was trying to figure out how to get my pictures to work at the top of each site so i went to AI and asked it questions about how to do this luckily it did know how to do this pretty quick and only took a few tries to set up which was better then how long it took the site to get up. Luckily AI explains everything it does and how it achieved it which makes it a lot easier to understand and how to modify it later one thing it does do bad in this aspect is when it explains something but it doesnt get it right i know this probably has something to do with my guidance to the AI or the fact that i’m broke and using the free basic model of ChatGPT but sometimes this can throw me off of the right track and actually be a little harder. The next thing that happened is I asked ChatGPT to make me cards for my blogs and articles on the web page. This gave it a cleaner look and made it easier to read. I did edit the cards a little more to achieve the look I was going for but overall it helped make the cards. The next thing I used it for was maybe a mistake and took way too long but I do like the way it turned out and that was in the blog section trying to make the categories all their own buttons and for it to filter the blogs to only show those blogs with that tag was very hard to do. Luckily for me I have worked quite a bit with the HTML format so doing html code and CSS styling is nothing new to me but the part that was hard was getting the overall look I wanted while getting the javascript to work. Shame to say but I allowed AI to create the javascript to do this as I spent a bit trying to figure it out and couldn’t get it to work. On the other hand it took me an AI about an hour of back and forth to finally get a version that worked. The last thing that I used AI for was to add the back to blogs button at the top of the blogs and the scroll to top button that is in the bottom right corner the overall look and the button was done by me but i couldn’t get it to float to the right and stay on the page as you scrolled. This was the moment that I realized how different the code of this theme was to that of blowfish, the previous theme that I was using. The first main difference was that all of the style of the pages and how the index pages were layout was done by the layout category of the code i had to put all of the styling that i wanted done and the layout of all the home pages into this layout section i tried for a while to get the site to accept the _index.md and the index.md pages as the start to those pages but that didn’t work the only way to fix these was to put everything into the layout folder under the html that needed to be used in this. AI tipped me off on this and gave me a very good way to do this and to use all that code. Unfortunately this code differed from that of the code i am normally used to so i had to use AI in order to help me get the base layouts for some of the pages. The theme did come with the layout for the main page though so I copied off of it and used that to help me with the other pages as they were all fairly similar. By far the place that AI was the most helpful or at least helped me the most even if it did lead me astray was in the creation of the Hugo site and how to set up the theme and get it working without this tiny bit of guidance then the site would have not gotten done since i would have never been able to get it started or at least with an easier theme. AI is also good at doing code; it doesn\u0026rsquo;t always get it right but with enough guidance it tends to eventually get the answer. One way it falls short is it\u0026rsquo;s not good at making things, at least in the sense of getting it to do what you want it to do. For instance, I wanted the boxes to look a certain way and it was just not fully pulling it off. It would also sometimes try to edit code that already worked or go back to something that was already fine. This would be annoying especially when I think I have that part finished and then it wants to change it and I have to be like NO. As I said earlier, sometimes it leads you astray and doesn\u0026rsquo;t always get the answer right but it does try to correct its mistakes so as long as i don\u0026rsquo;t believe everything it says then it\u0026rsquo;s not too bad. Overall I think AI is a helpful and good learning tool but it can be used as a bad thing in order to cheat that whole process but as long as it is used for good and in some sort of moderation I think it is helpful.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/articles/page4/","title":"The Use of AI"},{"content":" There are many things I like to do in my everyday life but there is one thing I enjoy above all and that is playing video games. With the use of platforms like steam on the computer there are almost infinite games to play and that being said there is one game that i liked to play above the rest and that was rocket league. Back when i started playing rocket league it was a simple game that can be defined in just a few words “Car Soccer\u0026quot;. The whole concept seemed odd at first. Why would I want to drive around a field chasing a ball to play soccer? That\u0026rsquo;s where it gets entertaining.\nRocket league used to be called supersonic acrobatic rocket powered battle cars or SARPBC for short this game didn\u0026rsquo;t have many things to do and was overall a simple idea to drive into the ball and put it in the net but that\u0026rsquo;s not what it became. Over the years rocket league has developed far beyond what even the developers thought it would become. With a simple name change and some upgraded graphics that when it became the staple it is today. The game was fun to me with this simple concept but that\u0026rsquo;s what was so good about it. Anyone could pick up the game and already know what needs to be done. There are no hard rules to learn and no set guideline of how to play. All you need to do is drive into the ball. This is when the game turned and people got better.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s when mechanics came into play. These are cool shots you can do while playing these games. This includes musty flicks which involve flicking the ball off of the car to get power. Flip resets which involves getting a reset or your flip back while having possession of the ball. There are so many more to name: pogos, ground pinch, kuxir pinch, brezzi flick and so much more but that\u0026rsquo;s just to name a few. Most of these mechanics are named for what they do like a ground pinch is literally pitching the ball between the floor and your car to get a lot of power and other mechanics are named based off of the person that found them. These come into play every game as each person tries to do them and doing one correctly can decide the fate of the game. The double jump originally rocket league cars could only do one jump but then the developers added a second jump this made most of the mechanics possible as it allowed the car to move in ways it never could prior. That\u0026rsquo;s when a major bug was found in order to reset your double jump and to get it back you had to land all four wheels back on the ground. This made it so you can get your jump back but also couldn\u0026rsquo;t use it infinitely. People discovered that if you land on the ball in a certain way you can actually reset this flip and get another one off this created so of the most powerful and new mechanics like the flip reset.\nThe game tries to be balanced by ranking each player by their skill level from bronze all the way to supersonic legend where everyone aims to be. Only the top .1% of players actually make it there. This separates players by skill level so that you go against people that are similar in rank to you this creates a semi balanced game as both sides should be similar but it creates a lot of different games as each players play style and skill differs quite a bit. Currently I\u0026rsquo;m a diamond 3 / champ 1 player but it has also been a minute since I last played so that rank can differ a little.\nFinally the takeover this is when epic games the creator of fortnite took over rocket league in doing so when they bought it they made it free to play meaning anyone can download and play the game this made the influx of the player base skyrock and allowed for a lot of new diverse skills to enter the game but this also created a big problem… in making the game free they invited people to be smurfs this is when a player that was high skill level would make a second account and play the game but either play internally bad or play with one of their lower ranked friends this would be because either they couldn\u0026rsquo;t play rank with that friend because the ranks are too far apart or they just wanted to play lower level matches but you can see how this starts to become unfair now that making a new account was free and didn\u0026rsquo;t cost the user 20$ dollars and rebuy the game the players could make themselves seem worse and they end up just dominating the other team since the skill level is so off. The next thing that epic did was get rid of trading this made it so that players could no longer give each other items meaning that if you had something valuable and wanted to trade it for something you liked more you can no longer do that these things started to make the game less fun i could no longer trade cool items i got for something i wanted more and every game that you went into the opponents skill level was higher then they should be this made the game it is today and that\u0026rsquo;s fine with me. But it\u0026rsquo;s no longer my first picked game and after having over 1000 hours in the game it disappoints me a little.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/articles/page1/","title":"What Rocket League Has Become"}]
